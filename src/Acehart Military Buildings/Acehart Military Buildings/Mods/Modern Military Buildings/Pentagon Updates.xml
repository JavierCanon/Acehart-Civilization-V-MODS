			<Set Help="The Pentagon Wonder places a free Military Headquarters in the city where it is built, provides +3 [ICON_CULTURE] Culture and +1 [ICON_GREATPEOPLE] Great Merchant points. Finally, it reduces the cost of upgrading units by 33%. Since a Military Headquarters provides a huge XP bonus to units, this is a seriously useful Wonder for any civilization expecting a lot of late-game combat."/>
