>>> Early Era Archery Buildings v1 <<<

Practice Range:
-- Archery Tech
-- Gives the promotion Accuracy I
-- Increases prduction of ranged units by 10%
-- Gives no (zero) free experience.
-- No limit to how many can be built. City-States can build.
-- costs 1 gold per turn in maintenance but is quick to build.
-- everything about the Practice Range is intended to make it inexpensive while providing a modest boost to the effectiveness of Archers in the early game. Building far too many of them in the early game will be a losing proposition, though.

Archery Range:
-- Mathematics Tech
-- Increases prduction of ranged units by 20%
-- Gives 10 XP to Ranged units
-- Requires a Practice Range
-- No limit to how many can be built. City-States can build.
-- Costs 3 gold per turn in maintenance and is expensive to purchase.

Artillery Range
-- Metal Casting Tech
-- Increases prduction of siege units by 20%
-- Gives 15 XP to Siege units
-- Requires an Archery Range
-- Each Civ can build only 3. City-States are not allowed to build.
-- Costs 3 gold per turn in maintenance and is really expensive to purchase.

None of these buildings can ever be captured when a city is conquered, so there's no way a player can get an 'extra' artillery range, for example.
